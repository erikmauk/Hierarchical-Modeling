Computational Art: Lab 8 (Duck Walk)

In this lab, I was given a bit of code for a simple duck.
However, only the neck moved back and forth, hinged to the body.
For my part, I made the wings flap, the legs walk, and the head move back and forth, all hinged in different places.
Once the user clicks the screen, the animation starts.

When I was growing up, there was a viral YouTube video called the Duck Song (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtN1YnoL46Q).
Naturally, when I was given code for a duck, I just knew I had to try and recreate it.

Within this repository, you will find a demo video of the final product attached. Enjoy!
